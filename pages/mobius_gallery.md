# Möbius Gallery

Möbius Gallery is an open-source web-app for creating web galleries of Möbius Modeller scripts. The
gallery allows visitors on the web to view and execute scripts in the gallery. For staff, a secure
log-in portal is provided.  

Galleries are hosted in the cloud, on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform.
