The tools in the Möbius Ecosystem can be adapted to many different use case. For example, Möbius
Modeller can be customised to different domains by developing specialized function libraries and
specialized viewers. 

[Contact us](contact.html) if you are interested in applying any of the tools in The Möbius
Ecosystem.

## Rapid Urbanism Explorer

The Rapid Urbanism Explorer is an Augmented Intelligence (AI) Platform to support decision makers in
developing new urban districts in advanced ways. Rapid iterative virtual prototyping empowers
stakeholders to produce complex urbanization scenarios integrating spatial, temporal, socioeconomic
and environmental parameters in real time.
