# Overview

The Edx Generator is a Python library of generating Edx Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) from
markdown saved in a hierarchical folder structure. 

The user writes the content opf teh MOOCs as a series of markdown files. These files can be
developed collaboratively, using existing tools such as Git version control. This makes the process
of creating and managing the MOOC content more efficient. 

The Edx Generator library is then used to process the markdown files, and to generate a single zip
file containing all the data required to create the whole course. This zip files can be imported
into the Edx MOOC, which will create the complete MOOC content.

The Edx Generator has built-in support for embedding Mobius Modeller exercises
