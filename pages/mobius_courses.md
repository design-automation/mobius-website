# Möbius Courses

Since 2017, the tools in The Möbius Ecosystem have been used to teach Spatial COmputational Thinking
to thousands of students.

Two types of courses have been developed:
- Spatial Computational Thinking Professional Certificate Programme available worldwide, via the Edx
  platform. The programme consists of three courses: Procedural Modelling, Generative Modelling, and
  Performative Modelling.
- Spatial Computational Thinking courses at the National University of Singapore, for students from
  within the university.
