# Möbius Courses

Since 2017, the tools in The Möbius Ecosystem have been used to teach Spatial Computational Thinking
to thousands of students.

Two types of courses have been developed:
- Spatial Computational Thinking Professional Certificate Programme available worldwide, via the Edx
  platform. The programme consists of three courses: Procedural Modelling, Generative Modelling, and
  Performative Modelling.
- Spatial Computational Thinking courses at the National University of Singapore, for students from
  within the university.

# Möbius Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on Edx

A Professional Certificate Programme was developed on teh Edx platform, consisting of four course:

- Spatial Computational Thinking: Procedural Modelling
- Spatial Computational Thinking: Semantic Modelling
- Spatial Computational Thinking: Generative Modelling
- Spatial Computational Thinking: Performative Modelling

The Professional Certificate Programme has been delivered three times: 

- In the first iteration, from Jan 2020 to Apr 2020, the four courses were delivered as
  instructor-led. 
- In the second iteration, from Sep 2020 to Feb 2021, the four courses were delivered as self-paced.
  This meant that learners would follow the courses at their own pace, in an asynchronous manner.
- In the third iteration, from Sep 2021 to Feb 2022, the content was re-structured into three
  courses. The courses were delivered as self-paced.
