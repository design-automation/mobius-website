# Overview

The Möbius Ecosystem encompasses various open-source tools and libraries for supporting spatial
computational thinking. At the core of this ecosystem is Möbius Modeller, a parametric modelling
application for the web. 

* Go to the [latest version of Möbius Modeller](https://mobius-08.design-automation.net).

The Möbius Ecosystem has been developed by the [Design Automation
Laboratory](https://design-automation.net), at the National University of Singapore.

The Director of the Design Automation Lab and the Principal Investigator for the Mobius development
is [Assoc. Professor Patrick Janssen](https://patrick.janssen.name).

The Möbius Modeller can be customised to different domains by developing specialized function
libraries and specialized viewers. Contact us if you are interested in applying the Möbius Modeller
in your domain.
