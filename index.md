# Overview

The Möbius Ecosystem encompasses various open-source tools and libraries for supporting spatial
computational thinking. At the core of this ecosystem is Möbius Modeller, a parametric modelling
application for the web. 

* Go to the [latest version of Möbius Modeller](https://mobius-08.design-automation.net){:target="Mobius"}.

The Möbius Ecosystem has been developed by the 
[Design Automation Laboratory](https://design-automation.net){:target="DAL"}
, at the National University of Singapore.

The Director of the Design Automation Lab and the Principal Investigator for the Mobius development
is [Assoc. Professor Patrick Janssen](https://patrick.janssen.name){:target="PatrickJanssen"}.

Möbius Modeller can be customised to different domains by developing specialized function libraries
and specialized viewers. [Contact us](contact.html) if you are interested in applying the Möbius
Modeller in your domain.
